# Nearest Airport
A function to determine the nearest airports from an inputted location and save this information onto a map.
## Getting Started
First of all we start by downloading software that is required for the operation of this function. These are detailed below. 
## GitHub: 
Firstly, Git should be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/downloads. Git is software development and version control service, with GitHub acting as an internet hosting service for users. GitHub requires the user to create an account at https://github.com/. Following account creation, users can create their own repository and project as well as access work from other users, such as the Nearest Airport function described in this document. The fork function allows users to copy and paste repositories onto their computer. The Nearest Airport repository should be forked onto the userâ€™s repository. Another useful application is the GitHub desktop, available at https://desktop.github.com/. Once logged in using the previously created details, users can push (upload) and pull (download) changes from the repositories. 
## Anaconda Navigator: 
Following this, Anaconda should be installed from https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/. Anaconda Navigator is a desktop based graphical user interface (GUI). Its primary function is to manage conda packages and launch applications from one location. Follow the steps listed on the install page to configure the application. 
## Conda: 
Once the repository has been cloned and Anaconda Navigator has been installed, a conda environment can be configured. Conda is a package management system for the installation of software packages. To set a Conda environment, select the Environments panel in Anaconda Navigator and select import. Import the environment.yml file from the cloned repository. For more information, visit https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/index.html.
## PyCharm: 
PyCharm is recommended to run the script. PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used for programming in python. Currently, modification of the script to enter the users location is required, with the development of a jupyter notebook in progress to remove this requirement. PyCharm can be downloaded from Anaconda Navigator.
